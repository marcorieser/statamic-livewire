    | So called synthesizers allow to add custom types to Livewire, which can
    | can be used to make Livewire aware of Statamic classes that you want
    | to work with, as it might make things easier.
    |
    | It's recommended to remove or uncomment those synthesizers that are
    | not used in your application, to avoid overhead by loading those.
    |
    | This features is experimental. It's meant to be tested and to played
    | with. As long as it is experimental, it can be changed and removed
    | at any point without a warning.
